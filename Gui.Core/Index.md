# Welcome to noesisGUI v3.2.10!

![logo.png](https://www.noesisengine.com/docs/logo.png)

This document describes how to use noesisGUI and how to start familiarizing yourself with the XAML format. XAML is a declarative XML-based language created by Microsoft that is used in several technologies like Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), Silverlight, Windows Store apps and Universal Windows Platform (UWP). NoesisGUI is a multiplatform graphical user interface middleware for realtime applications that understands XAML. Thanks to that, professional tools like [Blend](https://www.noesisengine.com/docs/Gui.Core.BlendTutorial.html) can be used to design your interfaces.

# Changelog

See what's new for this release. Our [Release Notes](https://www.noesisengine.com/docs/Gui.Core.Changelog.html) offer brief description of enhancements, bug fixes and new features for this and past versions.

# Class Hierarchy

The indexed reference of framework classes is located in the [Class Hierarchy](https://www.noesisengine.com/docs/Gui.Core._ClassHierarchy.html) list. This index can be used to discover what parts of XAML are implemented or not by noesisGUI. Within the description of each class supported Events, Properties and Methods are documented.

# Samples

Within the SDK for each platform you can find many examples. Many of them are available in all our supported APIs. That way you can see the same sample implemented as a C++ project, inside a Unity package or as an Unreal project. We also provide a centralized site at [GitHub](https://github.com/Noesis/Tutorials) where you can browse all our examples, read specific documentation for each one and inspect the source code. We are happy to accept pull requests to this repository.

# Tutorials

Although there is plenty of documentation on the [internet covering XAML](https://www.google.com/#q=XAML+introduction) (we strongly recommend following this [WPF tutorial](https://www.wpf-tutorial.com/)), the first steps you should perform to familiarize yourself with noesisGUI is reading the following tutorials we have prepared.
