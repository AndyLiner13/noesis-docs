# Canvas Class

## namespace [Noesis](https://www.noesisengine.com/docs/Gui.Core._ClassHierarchy.html#noesis-namespace) | [MSDN](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.controls.canvas.aspx)

Defines an area within which you can explicitly position child elements by using coordinates that are relative to the Canvas area.

```xaml
<StackPanel>
  <Canvas Height="400" Width="400">
    <Canvas Height="100" Width="100" Top="0" Left="0" Background="Red"/>
    <Canvas Height="100" Width="100" Top="100" Left="100" Background="Green"/>
    <Canvas Height="100" Width="100" Top="50" Left="50" Background="Blue"/>
  </Canvas>
</StackPanel>
```

A Canvas contains a collection of [UIElement](https://www.noesisengine.com/docs/Gui.Core._UIElement.html) objects, which are in the Children property.

Canvas is the only panel element that has no inherent layout characteristics. A Canvas has default Height and Width properties of zero, unless it is the child of an element tha automatically sizes its child elements. Child elements of a Canvas are never resized, they are just positioned at their designated coordinates. This provides flexibility for situations in which inherent sizing constraints or alignment are not needed or wanted. For cases in which you want child content to be automatically resized and aligned, it is usually best to use a [Grid](https://www.noesisengine.com/docs/Gui.Core._Grid.html) element.

The ZIndex property determines the order in which child elements that share the same coordinate space appear. A higher ZIndex value for one child element indicates that this element will appear above another child element that has a lower value.

If you specify them, the attached properties Canvas.Top or Canvas.Left take priority over the Canvas.Bottom or Canvas.Right properties.

Child elements of a Canvas are always given the full size that they desire. As a result, vertical alignment and horizontal alignment have no effect inside a Canvas.
